# XML PARSING WITH PYTHON

## The objective of the project is to analyze a given xml file and extract useful data from it in a structured way.

#### XML: Extensible markup Language. Designed to store and transport data, similar to the JSON often used in APIs.
#### In this project we will analyze an RSS feed which is in essence an XML file

* Rendered RSS is the RSS feed of top news from a popular website

### This project focuses on using Python's built-in xml module, which allows us to parse XML, but precisely we will use the XML elementTree API contained in this module.
